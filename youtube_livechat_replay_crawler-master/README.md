# Watch Out!!!

Youtube is monetizing by showing ads to humans.
In other words, it's not desirable for them to have machines watching Youtube. Because machines don't respond to ads.
So you... when you run this program, make sure it doesn't touch the wrath of Youtube.
If you are going to run this program in a corporation, I recommend you to go to Youtube's terms and conditions before you do anything fancy.
If you're a private person, do it within the scope of Youtube's generosity.
